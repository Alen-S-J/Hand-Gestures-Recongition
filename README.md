# Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset

The Hand Gesture Recognition dataset is a collection of images representing various hand gestures, captured from different races, ages, and genders. The dataset is designed for recognizing gestures related to rock, paper, and scissors hand signs. Each image has been labeled according to the respective gesture it represents, and the dataset has been curated for training, testing, and validation purposes.

## Overview

The purpose of the Hand Gesture Recognition dataset is to provide a diverse and comprehensive collection of hand gesture images for experimentation and research. The images in the dataset have been generated using CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) techniques. This unique approach was taken to explore the viability of using CGI-based data for classification tasks when compared against real images.

## Dataset Details

- **Gestures**: The dataset comprises three hand gestures: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Image Diversity**: The images feature hands from different races, ages, and genders, making the dataset diverse and representative of real-world scenarios.
- **Image Background**: All images are posed against a uniform white background, ensuring consistent visual elements.
- **Image Dimensions**: Each image is of size 300Ã—300 pixels, using a 24-bit color representation.
- **Image Count**: The dataset consists of a total of 2,892 images, categorized into train, test, and validation sets.
